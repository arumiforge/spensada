# CLAUDE.md — Spensada

Entry point for Claude Code and every sub-agent working in this repository.
The files imported below are loaded automatically at session start. Keep
this file short; put details in `.claude/memory/`.

## Read first

- Product: **Spensada** (product name). School: **SMP 1 DAWE**. Details: `.claude/memory/project.md`.
- Specs live in `docs/` (Indonesian) and are the source of truth. Start at `docs/00-project-overview.md` §11 (rules for the AI implementer).
- If an instruction is ambiguous, or conflicts with `docs/` or with `.claude/memory/decisions.md`: **stop and ask the owner**. Do not guess, do not silently pick one side.

## Hard rules (short version)

1. **Chat in English**, always — even when the owner writes in Indonesian.
2. **Code, comments, commit messages, PRs, and agent prompts in English.**
3. **UI text in friendly, non-technical Indonesian.** URL slugs in Indonesian.
4. **No Claude attribution** anywhere: no `Co-Authored-By`, no `Claude-Session`, no "Generated with Claude Code". Commits are authored by the repo owner only.
5. **One phase = one branch**, small commits, `type(scope): summary` format. `main` is the only long-lived branch.
6. **Stay inside your assigned files.** No unrequested refactors, renames, or new dependencies.
7. **All user-facing dates, times, numbers, and money go through `app/Helpers/format_helper.php`.**
8. **Update `.claude/memory/progress.md`** at the end of every task that changes the repo.
